DeepOnion-Qt and DeepOniond
===========================

Setup
---------------------
DeepOnion-Qt is DeepOnion client with graphic interface. DeepOniond is the daemon for DeepOnion. They download and, by default, store the entire history of DeepOnion transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download DeepOnion-Qt/DeepOniond, visit [deeponion.org](https://deeponion.org).
